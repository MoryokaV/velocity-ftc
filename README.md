What is Velocity?
> We are a group of students of the National College 'Gh. M. Murgoci' Brăila, who guided by our mentor, computer science teacher Pruș Paul, founded 4 years ago the first robotics club in the county, Velocity, which aims to develop young people's skills by carrying out STEM-type educational activities, both for their future, as well as that of technology. Today, we form two teams, Velocity Red and Velocity Blue, and the main goal of the club is to build robots that meet the requirements of this year's competitions. We also learn certain values that we must respect in our path to success, such as teamwork, tolerance, discovery, innovation, and last but not least, fun.
